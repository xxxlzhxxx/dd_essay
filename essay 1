Describe a group or community that you belong to.

The community which grants me the most sense of belonging is the debating club. Consisting 20 people in our school, our club attends all the debating competition held within the university and has achieved great results. As the “idea creator” in our club, I can always come up with novel thesis in every topic, bringing laughter and inspirations to the whole club. I also role as an instructor, helping our freshman rookies gain basic knowledge of debating.
 
The debating club enhances my skill of critical thinking, training me to view a simple case in a large scale and a rigorous way. For example, before we discussed the topic “Whether we should use an unjust scheme to realize a just outcome when there are no alternatives”, I just simply believe that people could do anything as long as the result is beneficial in general. But after the discussion and the debate, I came to realize the long-term negative effects in society and morality when an unjust method is allowed and the drawbacks of classical utilitarianism. Every time finishing a debate, I feel I have gained a deeper insight and a boarder horizon to a certain issue.

As a club member, I am always touched by the friendly atmosphere and the contagious up-lifting emotions. During competitions, we fully trust each other and our camaraderie got boosted. In daily life, our senior clubmates also provide me millions of wise suggestions, which help me to stay on the right track. We like family members, comrades, teachers and learners.
